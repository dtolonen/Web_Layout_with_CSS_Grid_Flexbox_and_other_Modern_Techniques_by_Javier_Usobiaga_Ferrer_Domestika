                Friday, March 29, 1912, Captain Robert F. Scott writes in his
                his diary his last words: "For God's sake, take care of the
                our". It is found in a tent in Antarctica at 700
                km. from the South Pole. He is accompanied by Lieutenant Bowers and Doctor Wilson,
                all of them in an extreme situation, and aware of the
                inevitability of the outcome. Outside, with temperatures around
                -40 ºC, a terrible blizzard that seems to have no end holds them back
                immobilized. <br class="mobile-break"> <br class="mobile-break"> Inside, the situation is not much better.

                expedition. Under normal conditions they would be less than two
                days of marching to reach what they had called "Deposit of
                the Great Tonne", located less than 20 km away. Reaching this deposit,
                located at 79º 29' S, it is essential to be able to return to the
                base located on Ross Island. Even so, they would still have more than
                200 km. for the purpose of the expedition, but unable to reach
                this provisioning, death approaches them inexorably, and they are
                aware of it.

                The warehouse is located in the middle of the vast plain with boxes
                stacked up to a height of 2 meters. By his decision it was established
                farther than initially anticipated. A year ago he made a decision
                that would be key to the outcome of the expedition. Affected by
                the suffering the horses were enduring - one of them
                found completely bloody- he ordered to establish the
                provisioning 56 km earlier than planned, at 80º latitude,
                for he could not violate his convictions by advancing a few
                kilometers more.

                fuel for one, they also need to get water, since
                melting snow and ice directly in your mouth requires a few
                calories that they already lack, and that, paradoxically, increases the
                dehydration.

                Scott keeps wondering what has gone wrong. As head of the
                expedition has had to make hard decisions. He was aware that
                the fate of 5 men was going to depend on the success of the planning and
                now, inevitably, they are all going to die in the attempt to
                conquest of the South Pole. What has gone wrong?
                planning?, the diet -are they totally malnourished-?,
                The horses? The equipment? These and many other questions are not
                they stop harassing Scott.

            <p>
                After so many efforts to reach the destination - on January 17
                they had reached the south pole - they receive a hard blow when they see the flag
                Norway waving, and check that the other expedition has
                advanced; but undoubtedly even harder is the return, with the
                death of two of his companions. First, Lieutenant Evans,
                gigantic and womanizer, lover of beer, which occurs during the
                descent of the glacier; and then Captain Oates who, on the day of his
                His 32nd birthday, he leaves the store never to return. both behaved
                in an exceptional way, enduring pain without complaining, without
                allow oneself to be overcome by adversity, in an attitude of value
                extraordinary. However, the physical problems of both
                slowed down the expedition, also marking its destination, and now it is
                they are unable to reach the supply point.
            </p>
            <p>
                After several attempts to resume the march, they fail due to the
                adverse weather conditions. Scott tries to cheer up, but
                his strength leaves him, in those moments he misses being able to continue
                writing in his diary, with so many things to tell. But write,
                something that may seem so simple to us, in its conditions supposes
                quite a daunting task. Malnutrition and dehydration will
                prevent. Despite his failure, he already only hopes that the whole world
                recognize the worth of these men.

                It is now 100 years since one of the greatest milestones of the
                exploration of the planet, the conquest of the South Pole, which also,
                of extraordinary human interest, with a career between
                Norwegian Roald Amundsen, final winner, and British Scott who,
                In addition to being defeated in this contest, he would pay with his life for the
                try. It is worth stopping to know some details of these
                fascinating expeditions to the last still unexplored corner of the
                planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the background of this expedition, we can find that
                Amundsen participated as helmsman in the Belgian Antarctic expedition of
                1897, where Cook also participated, and later directed the first
                expedition that managed to cross the mythical northwest pass between the
                Pacific and Atlantic oceans; so he was already an accomplished and
                renowned explorer. The same thing happened with the other contender,
                Scott, who made a first reconnaissance expedition in 1900
                with the ship Discovery, and where they reached 82°17' S of latitude
                setting the record of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, another member of Discovery, Ernest Shackleton, made
                an attempt in 1907 aboard the Expedition. For which they established
                his base on Ross Island, and made their attempt using ponies
                of Manchuria instead of dogs, which had not given the results
                previously expected. However, on this occasion
                he improved a lot with the change, having to rely fundamentally on the
                shot of the men themselves for transport. The expedition was at
                about to succeed, reaching 88°23' and only remaining
                180 km. del Polo, making the decision to back down before the high
                risk of their own lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1910, aboard the Terra Nova, Scott made a new attempt,
                correcting some of the defects observed by the own
                Shackleton. So he could achieve success, which he finally achieves,
                although with the consequences that we already know. He uses dogs as shots,
                horses and fundamentally the human effort itself; and furthermore, in
                a meritorious commitment to technology, he also carries three sleds
                motorized with tracks, although all prototypes are still experimental,
                the best of which sank during unloading. However, your
                fundamental bet of him, as Shackelton did, were the horses and
                his own men his; which was one of his first mistakes.

                The same year the Amundsen expedition takes place. although this
                explorer initially poses his expedition as directed to the Pole
                North, getting the Norwegian government to give him the ship Fram, a
                sailboat perfectly adapted to polar navigation, assisted by a
                coal engine than Amundsen himself, also in a bid for the
                emerging technology, replaced by another diesel. After his departure from
                Norway, on the stopover in Madeira, announces to the world, completely by
                surprise, the change of his plans, and his new route to the South Pole, and
                avoiding making new stopovers, in order to prevent the possible reception
                of return orders from the Norwegian government, which could
                fear of antagonizing the powerful United Kingdom. This change was due
                to the fact that the North Pole had already been conquered, settling also in
                those moments the dispute between Peary and Cook for its authorship, for which
                he anticipated little recognition if he accomplished that feat. as traction
                for the sledges, Amundsen made a wiser decision than his
                opponent of him He relied solely on huskies, perfectly
                trained and knowledgeable keepers of him, who now functioned at
                The perfection.
            </p>
            <p>
                In their approach to the attack, both followed similar lines;
                establishing base camps, and supply depots for
                the return. Scott established it on Ross Island and followed the same
                Shackelton's route for the ascent to the plateau. The last and main
                of his deposits he called it the "Great Tonne", although, and as already
                we have commented had to be established 56 km. ahead of schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                For his part, Amundsen established his base in the Bay of Whales,
                that he was situated somewhat closer to the target than the British base, if
                he well he had the drawback that the route to follow was completely
                unknown. During the previous summer he managed to establish three
                deposits, at heights of 80º, 81º and 82º, which facilitated the
                later way back. Furthermore, Amundsen made no qualms about
                feed the dogs, and even themselves, with the dogs
                deceased or directly slaughtered when they were no longer needed,
                what the British did not do because of Scott's own opposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the southern summer both expeditions leave for their destination. The
                Norwegians on October 19, and the British on November 1. Already
                from their first steps Amundsen's dogs function to the
                perfection, although half of them are sacrificed upon reaching perfection.
                top of the plateau, being no longer necessary. On the contrary,
                Scott's combination of dogs, horses, and motorized vehicles doesn't
                give the expected results.
            </p>
            <p>
                On December 14, the Norwegians reach their goal, the South Pole,
                while the British in those moments have only reached the plateau
                superior, with little more than half of the way done. Those
                they begin to return, with time getting worse for the misfortune of the
                British. Scott manages to reach the Pole on January 17, while
                Amundsen, with an already exhausted team, manages to reach the first
                deposit of provisions and regain strength. At the finish, the British
                find the Norwegian flag and a letter from Amundsen addressed to
                they. The famous photo they took reflects the despondency they must have
                feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                The road back for Scott's team was extremely hard,
                much more than for the Norwegians, due to the extreme conditions
                climatic. And while on January 25, they arrive at their destination
                final, the Bay of Whales, by then Scott and his team were still
                They have not reached 88º. On February 7th they reach the limit of the
                plateau completely exhausted, and in unbelievably atrocious weather
                they must invest more than a month in their descent, and in that interval they
                produces the death of the first fallen, Evans. March 17 occurs
                the death of Oates who, unable to continue, decides to leave
                camp at night without warning, in order to avoid being a burden to
                his companions, who refused to abandon him. But that generous
                sacrifice is useless because finally, on March 20, they see
                definitively stopped by a great storm, having already exhausted
                broadly all his might. They were 18 km away. from the deposit of
                the Great Ton, which they would have already reached if they had been located in
                the intended location, and perhaps saved their lives and even Oates's.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Amundsen's expedition was better prepared, Scott's,
                even with his flaws, he still might have succeeded had he not
                counted on extraordinarily adverse weather, one of the
                worst winters of those recorded in the entire 20th century, and even the
                bad luck of the moment chosen to establish the deposit for the
                return, where also due to bad weather they had to adopt their hard
                decision.

                Scott's diary, found next to his body, reflects his
                extraordinary personality of him, and contributed to his expedition having,
                if possible, greater recognition than that of the winner himself. And still today
                100 years after that feat, it is not possible
                remain indifferent when reading his last note: "We will resist
                until the end, but death cannot be far away. Is a
                It's a pity, but I think I won't be able to continue writing anymore. For the love of
                God, take care of us". As Stefan Zweig already said of this
                tragic story: "It is the greatest tragedy of all time,
                the one that, from time to time, manages to create a poet, and life thousands
                times".

                The publication of the newspaper somewhat obscured the triumph of
                Amundsen. He even contributed to underestimating his own
                difficulties in his, presenting them as less than what in
                reality were. On his victory, achieved after traveling 1,280 km.
                In 55 days he wrote in his diary: "The objective was reached, the
                journey... I can't say that I have reached my life's goal. The
                The North Pole had attracted me since childhood, and there it was, at the Pole
                South. Is it possible to imagine something more absurd?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, at the South Pole there is an international scientific base
                belonging to all signatory countries of the Antarctic Treaty and
                named after Amundsen-Scott base; what is a
                well-deserved explicit recognition for both explorers. What
                curiosity, indicate that it is quite displaced from the place reached
                100 years ago by the expedition members. Close to the base is
                the so-called Ceremonial South Pole, where a metallic sphere is located
